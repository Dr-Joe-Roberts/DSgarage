### Bootcamp overview  

The purpose of this self-guided, online **Bootcamp** is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge.  There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including **R Programming**, traditional **statistical analysis**, and **open science** tools.  We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.  


This **Bootcamp intro** page will help orient you if you are a beginner, but will also cover our design approach for the materials and the tools you will need to get started right away.  If you are already an RStudio user and comfortable managing and storing script files and scripts in R, you may  jump straight into the Bootcamp modules.

#### 0.0.1 How Data Science Garage works  

Data Science Garage aims to provide practical, open instructional materials.  The content is a blend of practical, referenced material with videos and self-assessment.  We also a have a [friendly community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/hadatascience/shared_invite/zt-ekigo1t3-0ADgafsF6zTDwJ9SxIws9w) - go over and introduce yourself and say hi!  


#### 0.0.2 R motivation  

The motivation for using R is that it is designed to help people with no programming experience to perform sophisticated statistical analysis with minimum effort.  R has grown in popularity over the past few decades and is used extensively by universities, companies and researchers everywhere.  R is free and open source.  R is easy to learn and works the same for folks with fast and slow computers, no matter what kind of computer they like to use, and it is easy to use via the web on any device.  


#### 0.0.3 Install R and RStudio **or** set up RStudio Cloud  

You have two options for following along with these materials as they are intended.  


**Option 1** [Download and install R from CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and then [download and install RStudio desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).  Install R first, then RStudio.  It is probably a idea to go ahead and install the latest version of each if you have older versions installed.  If you have a PC or laptop you regularly use, this option is probably best and will work for almost all hardware and operating systems.

**Option 2** If you can't install R or do not wish to, or if you prefer to work in "the cloud", you may wish to start a [free account at RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and follow along that way.
