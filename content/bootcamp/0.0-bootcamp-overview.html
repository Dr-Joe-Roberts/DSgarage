<h2>Bootcamp overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this self-guided, online <strong>Bootcamp</strong> is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including <strong>R Programming</strong>, traditional <strong>statistical analysis</strong>, and <strong>open science</strong> tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</p>
<p>This <strong>Bootcamp intro</strong> page will help orient you if you are a beginner, but will also cover our design approach for the materials and the tools you will need to get started right away. If you are already an RStudio user and comfortable managing and storing script files and scripts in R, you may want to jump straight into the Bootcamp modules.</p>
