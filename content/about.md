**Data Science Garage**  
This a repository created to help people do data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others.  The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources.  The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).

**Bootcamp**  
This is a self-guided tutorial designed for people new to data science, statistics and R, and for those who would like a review. The materials can help you get going with critical skills in **R programming**, traditional **data analysis** and **open science** tools. The aim is to provide open, foundational training you can build on in the most effiecient format possible. This will help prepare you for further training and to get you working with data in R as quickly as possible. The Bootcamp is self-paced and has built-in assessment materials. The material is meant to work through in order as an experience, but is not in any way intended to be a reference to the presented topics.
