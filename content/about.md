**Data Science Garage** is a repository created to help people do data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others.  The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources.  The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).

The online **Bootcamp** is designed to help you get going with critical skills in **R programming**, traditional **data analysis** and **open science** tools. The aim is to provide open, foundational training you can build on in an effiecient format, whether you are a beginner or have some experience. The Bootcamp is self-paced and has built-in assessment materials.
