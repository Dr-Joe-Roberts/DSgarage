      <description>Bootcamp overview The purpose of this self-guided, online Bootcamp is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including R Programming, traditional statistical analysis, and open science tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</description>

SCRIPT 1.1 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 We love the R language, but sometimes it is a little bit like talking to a passive aggressive butler - if you aren&amp;rsquo;t careful with your language, the interaction may have unexpected outcomes&amp;hellip;
 R is a programming language and popular open source software design to help non-programmers perform statistical analyses and to make graphs.</description>

 Overview
 R is like a big garage filled with useful tools.
 One of the best things about R is that it can be customized to accomplish a huge variety of kinds of tasks: perform all sorts of statistical analyses from simple to bleeding edge, produce professional graphs, format analyses into presentations, manuscripts and web pages, collaboration, GIS and mapping, and a lot more.</description>

SCRIPT 1.3 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 Imagine you are floating in space in the R Global Environment and any data object you can see, you can call on by name to manipulate with functions. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it R Space
 The fundamental way to analyse data in R is to be able to manipuate it with code.</description>

NB for this page we assume you have access to Microsoft Excel; however, similar spreadsheet software (like Libre Office Calc) will work fine.
 Overview
 The first step for getting your data into R is making your data tidy. The first step in using R for data analysis is getting your data into R.</description>

 Overview
 With a good basic set of moves for subsetting and manipulating data, you can overpower any dataset no matter how large and powerful they may be. Then, you will have strong data Sumo.
 Subsetting and manipuating data is probably the commonest activity for anyone who works with data.</description>

 I. A curve has been found representing the frequency distribution of standard deviations of samples drawn from a normal population.
II. A curve has been found representing the frequency distribution of values of the means of such samples, when these values are measured from the mean of the population in terms of the standard deviation of the sample…</description>

SCRIPT 2.3 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 Most of you will have heard the maxim &amp;ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&amp;rdquo;. Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with each other does not mean that one is responsible for the other. For instance, ice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because both occur more often in the summer heat.</description>

 Overview
 &amp;ldquo;The general rule is straightforward but has surprising consequences: whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean.&amp;rdquo; - Francis Galton
 One of the most common and powerful tools in the statistical toolbox is linear regression.</description>

 The t-test and t-distribution are widely considered to be at the very foundation of modern statistic science and they form an important foundation for the practice of statistics. Who would believe they were invented to make great beer better?
 William Sealy Gosset is credited with inventing and applying the idea of the t-test to assist in scientific quality control while working for the Guiness brewery.</description>
