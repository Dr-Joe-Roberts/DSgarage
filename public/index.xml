      <description>Bootcamp overviewThe purpose of this self-guided, online Bootcamp is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including R Programming, traditional statistical analysis, and open science tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</description>

The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).</description>
