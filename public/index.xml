      <description>Bootcamp overview The purpose of this self-guided, online Bootcamp is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including R Programming, traditional statistical analysis, and open science tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</description>

 Most of you will have heard the maxim &amp;ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&amp;rdquo;. Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with each other does not mean that one is responsible for the other. For instance, ice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because both occur more often in the summer heat.</description>

 Overview
 The t-test and t-distribution are widely considered to be at the very foundation of modern statistic science and they form an important foundation for the practice of statistics. Who would believe they were invented to make great beer better?
 William Sealy Gosset is credited with inventing and applying the idea of the t-test to assist in scientific quality control while working for the Guiness brewery.</description>

 Overview
 The analysis of variance is not a mathematical theorem, but rather a convenient method of arranging the arithmetic. R. A. Fisher (via Wishart 1934. Sppl. J. Roy. Soc. 1(1):26-61.)
 Perhaps more so than any other tool, the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) literally revolutionized the idea of objectivity in using data to produce evidence to support claims.</description>

      <description>Analysing data using R can generate complex scripts that might make sense to you while you&amp;rsquo;re actively working on them, but they won&amp;rsquo;t to future you or collaborators. This bootcamp module offers guidance to improve the reproducibility of your code for yourself and others. Following this guidance will also improve your R workflow and reduce errors.

      <description>As researchers we often want our collaborators to easily understand what we have done during an analysis. We could just share our raw data and code as it should be reproducible now you&amp;rsquo;ve completed module 3.1. It would be much better to create a reproducible report using RMarkdown that presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it. Of course, reproducible reports aren&amp;rsquo;t just a useful way of sharing analyses with collaborators but can also act as a record for yourself.</description>

      <description>Git and version control  Overview
 Have you ever accidentally deleted work on your computer and realized you needed it and lost work? And you were left with the terrible feeling you had to do it all again? Or had to make tedious revisions to merge work done on the same document with others? Git and Github fix all that.
  The practice of data science involves a lot of data, code, figures, tables, manuscripts, and other documents.</description>

      <description>Data Science Garage
This a repository created to help people do data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others. The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources. The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).</description>
